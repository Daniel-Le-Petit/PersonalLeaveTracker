 Leave Tracker - Deployment Guide for Render

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

### IndexedDB Considerations

**Current State**: The app uses IndexedDB for client-side storage, which means:
- ‚úÖ Data persists in the user's browser
- ‚úÖ Works offline
- ‚ùå Data doesn't sync across devices
- ‚ùå Data is lost if user clears browser data
- ‚ùå No server-side persistence

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Static Site Deployment (Recommended for MVP)
- Deploy as a static site on Render
- Keep IndexedDB for local storage
- Add export/import functionality for data backup
- Users can backup their data manually

#### Option 2: Full-Stack with Database (Future Enhancement)
- Add a backend API (Node.js/Express)
- Use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data persistence
- Implement user authentication
- Sync data across devices

## üìã Current Deployment Setup

### 1. Render Configuration
The app is configured for Render deployment with:
- **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Port**: 10000 (Render's default)
- **Environment**: Production

### 2. Data Persistence Strategy

#### For Current Deployment:
1. **Local Storage**: IndexedDB stores data in user's browser
2. **Backup System**: Export/Import functionality for data backup
3. **Fallback**: localStorage as backup if IndexedDB fails

#### Data Backup Features:
- Export data as JSON file
- Import data from JSON file
- Automatic localStorage backup
- Manual backup reminders

### 3. Deployment Steps

1. **Connect to Render**:
   ```bash
   # Push your code to GitHub
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy to Render"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render**:
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select "Web Service"
   - Use the configuration from `render.yaml`

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `PORT=10000`

### 4. Post-Deployment Considerations

#### Data Migration:
- Users will start with empty data
- They can import their existing data using the export file
- Recommend users to export their data before deployment

#### User Communication:
- Add a notice about data persistence
- Provide clear backup instructions
- Explain the export/import functionality

## üîß Future Enhancements

## üìù User Instructions

### For End Users:
1. **First Time Setup**: The app will start with empty data
2. **Data Import**: Use the import feature to restore previous data
3. **Regular Backups**: Export your data regularly
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Works best in modern browsers

### Backup Best Practices:
- Export data weekly
- Keep multiple backup files
- Test import functionality regularly
- Use different browsers for backup

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes

### IndexedDB Limitations:
- Browser-specific storage
- No cross-device sync
- Data loss on browser clear
- Size limitations (varies by browser)

### Performance Considerations:
- IndexedDB is fast for local operations
- No network latency for data access
- Works offline
- Limited by browser storage quotas

### Security:
- Data is stored locally
- No server-side data processing
- Export files contain sensitive information
- Users responsible for data security

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Data Loss Risk**: IndexedDB data can be lost if:
   - User clears browser data
   - Browser is uninstalled
   - Device is reset
   - Browser storage is corrupted

2. **Backup Strategy**: Always recommend users to:
   - Export data regularly
   - Keep multiple backup files
   - Test restore functionality

3. **Browser Support**: IndexedDB is supported in:
   - Chrome 23+
   - Firefox 16+
   - Safari 10+
   - Edge 12+

## üìû Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check Render logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test locally with production build
4. Check browser console for errors
